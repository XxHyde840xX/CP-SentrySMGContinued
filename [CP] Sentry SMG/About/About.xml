Spun out and updated by XxHyde840xX, fixes by Zaljerem. MASSIVE THANKS ZAL!

Big thanks to Paradox in the RimWorld discord server for the final balance pass. The sentry turret should be just as good as you all remember, if not better.

The Sentry SMG Turret, spun out from "Rimmu-Nation - Security" by Chicken Plucker, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011774401. All credit to Chicken Plucker, I just yanked the turret.
It sadly didn't make it to "Rimmu-Nation² - Security," and since I'm late to the party so to speak, I've done what I can so myself and others can enjoy some of CP's older stuff on the 1.4 version of RimWorld.
Make sure to check out Chicken Plucker's workshop, located at: https://steamcommunity.com/id/chickenplcker/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100, as well as their awesome mod collections!
The newest version of Rimmu-Nation² - Security can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563504596.

If the original author wishes at any time for me to remove this from the workshop, I will comply with their request to do so.
